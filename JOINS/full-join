#FULL JOIN
FULL JOIN creates the result-set by combining result of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN. The result-set will contain all the rows from both the tables. 
The rows for which there is no matching, the result-set will contain NULL values.

SELECT *
FROM Student
FULL JOIN StudentCourse 
ON StudentCourse.ROLLNO = Student.ROLLNO;
